# Actuarial Mortality Projection and Statistical Learning for Longevity Risk Management

ACST3059 Actuarial Modelling Group Case Study (2023)

Group project applied statistical learning to project Australian mortality for longevity risk management. Focused on quantitative projection, model validation, and actuarial implications.

## Key Tasks
- Group projection of mortality trends using statistical models  
- Analysed longevity risk and quantitative impacts  
- Validated models and assessed risk management strategies  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical learning for mortality projection  
- Longevity risk modelling and quantitative analysis  
- Group actuarial validation and risk assessment  

## Submission Details
- This was a group case study; personal submission was not made, so no individual files are available.  
- Group received 17/20 marks, with strong feedback on quantitative modelling and risk analysis.  
- Original R Markdown (.Rmd) and report files not retained by individual member.
